# Open Source Definition

An Open Source project is a project
that is made universally available
for the benefit of the public at large,
and whose source code can be freely used,
modified and shared.

In general, Open Source means[^1]:

1. **Access to the source code**,
   for no more than a reasonable fee,
   but preferably at no cost.

1. **Possibility to modify and share**,
   so that you can improve the software or portions of it,
   and then distribute the modified versions to whom you want.

1. **Freedom**,
   so that anybody can benefit from the software,
   with no discrimination against any person or group,
   field or endeavor,
   or other software or technology.

From the very outside,
Open Source is a model that encourages world-wide collaboration, cooperation, advancement of knowledge, and social impact.
