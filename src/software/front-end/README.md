# Front End

A front-end engineer is a software engineer who specializes in building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website or application. They are responsible for creating visually appealing and intuitive designs that allow users to interact with the application or website seamlessly.

The front-end engineer's job involves using various technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual elements of an application or website. They work closely with designers to turn mockups and wireframes into fully functional websites or applications that are easy to use and navigate.

Front-end engineers also collaborate with back-end engineers to integrate the front-end code with the back-end code, ensuring that the entire system functions correctly. They are responsible for testing and debugging the front-end code, optimizing the code for performance, and ensuring that the website or application is compatible with different browsers and devices.
