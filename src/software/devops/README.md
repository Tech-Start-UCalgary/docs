# DevOps

DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations professionals. The goal of DevOps is to improve the efficiency and quality of software development by breaking down silos and promoting a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.

Traditionally (<https://clickup.com/blog/waterfall-project-management/>), software development and IT operations have been two separate functions within organizations, with little interaction between them. DevOps seeks to bridge this gap by fostering collaboration between these teams throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from planning and development to deployment and maintenance.

DevOps involves using tools and practices such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure automation to streamline the software development process and make it more efficient. By automating tasks like testing, building, and deploying software, teams can reduce errors, speed up the development process, and deliver software more quickly and reliably.

Overall, DevOps is a holistic approach to software development that aims to create a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement, with the goal of delivering software more efficiently and with higher quality.
