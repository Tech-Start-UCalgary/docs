# First impressions matter

> First impressions matter, period.

It is essential for you as a developer
to know that making your project successful
is no different than selling a product.
They both obey what is called the
[Conversion Funnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_funnel):

1. Initially,
   100% of the users visit your project on GitHub.
1. Some of them walk away,
   and only 80% of the users read what your project is about.
1. Some of them walk away,
   and only 50% of the users decide to try your project.
1. More of them walk away,
   and only 5% of the users keep using your project on a regular basis.

No matter what your project is about,
if we want it to be successful
we need to be able to "Convert" users
from visitors to active users.
We want them to engage regularly with the project,
post issues, ask for features,
recommend us to friends,
give stars,
fork,
and even contribute back code
or financially support the project.

There are a few techniques that we can use to maximize the [Conversion Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_marketing).
