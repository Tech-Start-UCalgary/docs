# Demo & Pitch Nights

All Tech Start UCalgary projects are showcased to the world
at the end of each academic year.
At this event, people from different industries and backgrounds
come and give us feedback on the projects.

This is also a great opportunity for you as a professional and us 
as a club to connect and network with different companies.

It's important to remember that as an entrepreneurial club, you will
also be pitching your ideas to potential investors, so your hard work 
on the business strategy will be on display here. Pitching your start-up
in a convincing manner is a critical skill, so we also give you the opportunity to 
practice this. 

This year's showcase is scheduled for **April 27th, 2023**.
To prepare for this, we want each team to demo and pitch their project to 
the club before the showcase. This will help you get experience and valuable 
feedback from fellow project teams, execs, and our partners in industry.
