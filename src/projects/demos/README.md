# Demos

At Tech Start UCalgary
all projects are showcased to the world
at the end of each academic year.
In this event, people from different industries and backgrounds
come and give us feedback on the projects,
while also allowing you as a professional and us as a club
to connect and network with different companies.

This year's showcase is scheduled for **April 29th, 2023**.
To prepare for the showcase
we want each team to demo their project
on the last dev night of every month until the showcase.
Namely, February 2nd, March 16th, and April 6th, all in 2023.
