# Demo #3, April 6th

## Spirit

1. Do a final showcase simulation.
1. Show the world what you've built.
1. See what other teams have built.
1. No matter what, enjoy the process.

   The amount of hard work, dedication,
   and teamwork required to bring an idea to life is immense,
   and you should all feel incredibly proud
   of what you have accomplished in the last two seasons.
   You have overcome countless obstacles and challenges,
   honed your skills, and become a better version of yourself.
   Now, as you stand at the finish line
   and look back on what you have achieved,
   take a moment to appreciate how far you have come
   and how much you have grown.
   Your project is a testament to your passion, creativity, and perseverance,
   and it serves as a reminder that with the right mindset and determination,
   anything is possible.

## Agenda

The content is up to you!
The way you deliver your presentation matters,
so feel free to drop here your signature style.

Just remember that in the final showcase
(and therefore in this demo),
you'll have:

- Maximum 15 minutes for your presentation.
- Maximum 3 minutes for questions and answers.
- Most of the audience will be completely new to your project.
- Teams will present in the following order:

  1. Bandist.
  1. CyberHire.
  1. EasyMeal.
  1. LifeLine.
  1. AiRM.
  1. TechstArcade.

- The judges will score based on
  [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1scLIovkpHQizCwvwH1ql02NYGKR--tHjXpN2FT3Lsyw/edit?usp=sharing),
  so if you want to win some prizes you may want to optimize for that.

Lastly, just remember to look back on what you have achieved,
and take a moment to appreciate how far you have come
and how much you have grown.

We all feel very proud of you and believe in you.
