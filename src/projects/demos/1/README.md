# Demo & Pitch Night 1

## 30 November 2023

## Objectives

Demos are intended to be a check-in of your progress so far and a way for your whole team to show off their work, as well as an opportunity to practice pitching your project to the public.

This will also let us understand your progress and blockers in order to help you best.

Since Tech Start is built off 3 pillars, development, strategy, and design, the demos will also focus on these 3 aspects.
Feel free to divide the allocated time between them as you see fit.

In addition, there may or may not be pizza or snacks present.

## Time Limit: 15 minutes

## Suggested talking points

These are just suggestions and not at all mandatory, but may help get you started.
