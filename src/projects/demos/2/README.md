# Demo #2, March 16th

## Spirit

1. Get to know the technical side of your project
   a little bit more
   and the things you've build so far,
   or plan on building.
2. Discovering how we can help you.
3. Help you get out of the way the challenges you see.
4. Monitoring progress is not a goal,
   don't feel pressured,
   this Demo shouldn't require much preparation,
   and instead is more of a sincere conversation.

## Agenda

We'll go to the table where you are with your team
and talk with you there.

Driven by the project manager:

1. Elevator Pitch (30 - 60 seconds)

   > Goal: keep it short, sweet, and memoriable.

   - Introduce your project's name and members.
   - Discuss the problem you are attempting to solve
   - What is your solution?
   - How does your solution specifically addresses the problem.

2. Progress and Challenges faced since Demo #1:

   - Recap: What's your chosen tech stack (code, diagrams, designs, plots, ect)?
   - Overall, what has been worked on since Demo #1?
   - What are 3 main sucesses the team is proud of since Demo #1?
   - What are some major challenges that were encountered? How did you overcome them?

3. Roadmap for the Final Showcase:

   - What do you hope to achieve by the **Final Showcase on April 29th, 2023**?
   - Where do you sit on your timeline for progression for the above goal?
   - Are there any challenges you are currently facing or may face?
   - What resource(s) would be useful to help the team achieve the goal? For example, aid in understanding how to deploy in AWS or the app store from creditable and effective online resources or an industry professional.

4. Any closing thoughts?

May your projects be successful!
