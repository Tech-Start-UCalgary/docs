# UI/UX Design Guide

Welcome to Tech Start’s UI/UX design guide, your roadmap to mastering the art of crafting user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences!

Our goal is simple: to provide you with the tools and guidance necessary to understand the principles of effective design and apply them to your projects. Instead of overwhelming you with tutorials, we've curated a selection of online resources that cover everything from the basics to advanced techniques.

While this guide is a good starting point, there's a ton of resources available online. Everyone learns differently, so we encourage you to explore and find what methods work best for you! 

Enjoy the guide and have fun designing! :)

## Design Process

**Purpose:** a design process helps you break down a project into manageable chunks and gives your work structure. 

Terms like “design thinking” and “human-centered design” all boil down to the idea of understanding the needs and behaviors of users, and translating that understanding into a well-designed interface. So, **keep the user front and center in your design approach!**

There’s various design processes out there but we recommend using the double diamond design process.

**The double diamond design process has 4 stages:**

1. Discover 
2. Define
3. Develop 
4. Deliver

**Note:** this design process is not linear— it’s iterative. That means you may be revisiting certain stages to tweak and improve your designs as you work through the process.

### Tasks to do at each stage/ Methods to use

As you make your way through the design process there’s various tasks/ methods you may use at each stage. 

**Discover phase:** 
* Competitive analysis 
* User research

**Define phase**(at this stage you’ll be synthesizing your user research findings): 
* Affinity mapping
* Empathy mapping 
* Form a problem statement and How Might We (HMW) questions
* Ideate potential solutions  
* Product Requirement Doc (PRD)

**Note:** to make your work easier, use FigJam templates to do the tasks for this phase. 

Here’s some great FigJam Templates: 
* [Affinity mapping](https://www.figma.com/community/file/973596233310955890)  
* [Empathy mapping](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1157607115950793533)

**Develop:**
* User flows & site maps
* Wireframes & low-fidelity prototypes
* User testing prototypes and iterating on your designs based on user feedback 

Here’s some great FigJam Templates:  
* User flow diagram: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1174820493855619258
* Wireframing: https://www.figma.com/templates/wireframe-kits/

**Deliver:**
* High-fidelity prototypes (in Figma)
