# Elevator Pitch

## 21 November 2024

## Quick Info

### Objectives

Let everyone know what your product idea is, present progress so far and next steps.

This lets the executive and project support teams know how far you are and what your vision is to best provide the support and resources you need.

There will be more pitches and demos to come, so this will be a good warmup for them (as well as being a valuable skill in industry).

### Start Time

6 PM sharp

### Time Limit

**Hard** cutoff at 5 minutes

Then 3 minutes for Q&A

## What to do

Clearly state what exactly you're doing, what problem you're solving (if applicable), and how you plan to approach it.

Make it engaging and interesting, leave the audience with something memorable.

In your slide deck, avoid walls of text at all cost, use visuals instead.

We recommend not having more than 3 people presenting as this really messes with your presentation's flow as you hand off to them.

Speak loudly and clearly so everyone can hear you! Use the LAV mic if possible, and learn how to use it correctly. This [video](https://youtu.be/wd_f7iYbFrA) may help. Whatever you do, do not speak into it directly, you will make very loud and annoying popping sounds.

Rehearse your pitch and keep it under the time limit.

## What not to do

Don't get bogged down by details, this is a high level overview of your idea.

Don't get too technical, assume your audience is investors who know nothing about programming.

## Suggested talking points

These are just suggestions and not at all mandatory, but may help get you started.

- The problem
- The solution
- The target audience
- Tech stack
- Progress made (any kind)
- Next steps
- Roadmap/timeline
