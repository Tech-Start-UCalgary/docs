# Introduction

When I was first introduced to GitHub,
I had no idea what it was or what it could do.
Between you and me,
I created the account because I was required to do so by my university.

For the longest time as a beginner
I did nothing with my account.
But then,
because of my passion in tech,
I started following other developers
and checking out their work on GitHub,
and I noticed something they had in common:
they all had cool projects
and contributed to Open Source.
For example:
[@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus),
[@donnemartin](https://github.com/donnemartin),
[@kamranahmedse](https://github.com/kamranahmedse),
[@jwasham](https://github.com/jwasham),
[@trekhleb](https://github.com/trekhleb),
[@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo),
[@kamadorueda](https://github.com/kamadorueda),
among others:

This tutorial will guide you
through making your GitHub projects more awesome,
and by extension,
increasing your value as a developer.
