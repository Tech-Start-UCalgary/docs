# Management Styles

All management styles are useful depending on the specific scenario,
but it's important to identify when to use which one,
since a wrong management style conduces the team to a dissatisfied, unengaged, inefficient, unmotivated, or frustrated state.

The following document enumerates the trade-offs
of all management styles and I highly encourage you to read it.

I would just add a last tip here:

Understand what motivates every person on your team.

For instance,
remember that a team of volunteers is very different from a team of employees.
On a volunteering team, the motivation factors usually are
self-development and being part of a cause.
The key in this setup
is aligning the team's objectives
with each person's definition of meaningfulness.
