# Dealing With Conflict

Conflict resolution is the process of resolving differences
and disputes between individuals, groups,
or parties through peaceful means.
It involves identifying and addressing the underlying causes of the conflict,
promoting communication and understanding, cooperation,
and finding a mutually acceptable solution,
leading to increased productivity
and satisfaction in personal and professional settings.
When done correctly,
it helps to manage and resolve differences and disputes effectively,
preventing them from escalating into larger and more destructive problems.

The following document enumerates the trade-offs
of all conflict management styles,
and I highly encourage you to read it.

Lastly, remember that conflict is not a bad thing.
Instead, learn how to manage it and make the most out of it.
