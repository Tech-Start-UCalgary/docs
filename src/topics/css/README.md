# CSS

Is only recommended to learn CSS after you are familiar with HTML.

## Fundamentals

MDN is all you'll need: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS>.

Particularly, focus on:

1. Familiarize with the syntax, basic attributes and selectors.
1. **The Box Model**.
1. CSS Layouts
   (**Flexbox** and **Grids** as a minimum).
1. **Responsive Design** and **media queries**.
