# CSS

Is only recommended to learn CSS after you are familiar with HTML.

## Fundamentals

MDN is all you'll need.
Read it from beginning to end:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS>.

Particularly, focus on:

1. The basic syntax, common attributes (color, font, border)
   and basic selectors.
1. **The Box Model**.
1. CSS Layouts
   (**Flexbox** and **Grids** as a minimum).
1. **Responsive Design** and **media queries**.
