# Demo #1, February 2nd

## Spirit

1. Get to know the technical side of your project
   a little bit more
   and the things you've build so far,
   or plan on building.
2. Discovering how we can help you.
3. Help you get out of the way the challenges you see.
4. Monitoring progress is not a goal,
   don't feel pressured,
   this Demo shouldn't require much preparation,
   and instead is more of a sincere conversation.

## Agenda

We'll go to the table where you are with your team
and talk with you there.

Driven by the project manager:

1. Mention your project's name,
   the name of its members,
   and a short phrase about what your project is about,
   and what problem it solves for its consumers.

2. Walk us through your vision:

   - How do you want your project to look like 3 months for now?

   - Are there any challenges you are facing or may face?

   - What's your number 1 priority as a team right now?
   - What's your number 1 priority as a project manager?

3. Technical overview:

   - What's your chosen tech stack?

   > Note: "Source Code" below means code, diagrams, designs, plots, anything.

   - Walk us through how a Developer
     would clone/access your Source Code
     and get started contributing.

   - Walk us through your Source Code.

   - What would be the top 1 thing that if implemented
     would make your team contributing experience happier?

4. Any closing thoughts?
<!--

The spirit of this demo is to:

1. Allow each project to show the things they have worked on
   and receive feedback from other members of the club.

   We'll be your beta testers once there is something to test!
   And this initial feedback and market validation
   will hopefully help you shape a better project.

1. See the approaches that other teams took when building their project.

   So for instance, if your team is a web app,
   you'll be able to see firsthand how other teams work
   on a mobile app, robotics project, browser extension, etc,
   while also allowing them to learn about how you are building a web app.

1. Hear each team's challenges and experiences
   while working in their specific domain,
   using their chosen tech stack, and so on,
   allowing you to learn from other people's experiences.

## Guidelines

To make the most out of the demos,
please follow the following guidelines:

1. Mention your project's name,
   the name of its members,
   and a short phrase about what your project is about,
   and what problem it solves for its consumers.

   There is no need to be super-specific,
   but it’s useful to think
   that this demo can be the first point of contact
   for a new user with your project.
   we want you to be able to perfect this initial pitch.

   Please keep it simple.
   For example: “Hi there! This is Kevin from the TodoApp team.
   TodoApp is a mobile application that helps people
   keep track of the tasks they have to do
   in a friendly way so that they never forget them”.

1. For each of the things you have worked on so far
   but without including what you demoed in the previous month:

   1. Start by mentioning the purpose of what you have worked on so far
      and how it fits in the big picture.

      For example:
      “In this cycle we wanted our users to be able
      to customize the theme in the application.”

   1. Mention the why.

      For example: “Many of our users spend a lot of time using screens
      and we wanted to help them reduce eye strain by using a Dark theme.
      If you are one of those users who prefer a light theme,
      no worries,
      we have you covered:
      the theme choice is completely up to you.”.

   1. Walk the users through the tangible changes.

      For example: “To configure the theme, please click on your profile, scroll down to the end of the page, and check the theme of your preference.”

      Make sure you walk a user through your project as you are talking,
      you can show a live version of the functionality of your project,
      or you can show recordings or images.

   1. Repeat for each of the other things you worked on.

1. Mention what's in your [RoadMap](../roadmap/) for the next months.
   This is an awesome opportunity to get them excited for what's to come
   and also to get some early feedback/market validation
   even before starting with the implementation.

1. Make a close,
   you can remember users how to start using your project and
   where to provide feedback (GitHub issues for example),
   and maybe encourage them to click
   on the "star" button of your project repository.
   -->

May your projects be successful!
